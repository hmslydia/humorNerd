        HumorNerd is an online challenge to collaboratively mimic The Onion's style of humor. Our goals are to understand what is funny about The Onion and to be able to create humor that is as good as theirs.

        <br>
        Please do the following tasks in the order they are listed.<br>
        
        <!--
        <br>
        Help us find the funniest Onion jokes by rating how funny you find their jokes.<br>
        <br> 
         -->
         <!--
         Below are three tasks and their instructions. Please do them in order as best you can without worrying too much about whether you're doing it "right" or "giving me what I want." I just want your natural responses. And if you get stuck and don't know what to respond or don't understand what to do, I want to know that too.
